## Project Description
This project implements an AI-powered CAPTCHA solver using deep learning and image processing techniques. Users upload CAPTCHA images, and the system predicts the code using a trained neural network. The solution demonstrates preprocessing, model inference, and result visualization. The project showcases practical applications of DIP concepts in real-world automation.

## Objectives
- Automate CAPTCHA recognition using deep learning
- Apply image preprocessing for model compatibility
- Demonstrate end-to-end prediction workflow
- Visualize results for user validation

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- NumPy

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install keras opencv-python pillow numpy
   ```
2. Open `Code/main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Place the trained model file (`MyModel.keras`) in the `Code/` directory.
4. Run all cells in the notebook to process sample images and view predictions.
5. Upload or reference sample CAPTCHA images as needed.
- **Input:** Place sample images in `Dataset/sample_images_or_link.txt` or upload via the app interface.
- **Output:** Predicted results and images are saved in `Results/output_images/`.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of digital image processing and deep learning for automated CAPTCHA solving. The workflow integrates preprocessing, model inference, and result visualization, providing a practical solution for real-world image-based automation tasks. The project highlights the effectiveness of DIP techniques in AI-driven applications.
